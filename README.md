- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Emmshaa
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m particularly interested in NLP that I consider as a powerful tool to help investigators for a better workplace environment. I also realised that there is a great disconnect between the users and the experts building the algorithms and ML systems out of any regulatory or independent review. Negative aspects of a lack of privacy and ethics for children as well as adults, can be quite significant and need to be understood. Therefore in my opinion it is even more important to take action at the design & development phase of algorithms and autonomous systems.
- ðŸŒ± That is why I am currently learning Python to get a better understanding of those challenges that engineers can face on a day-to-day.
